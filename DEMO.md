## Complete Workflow Summary

1. **Admin (University)** → Issues certificate as NFT + PDF
2. **Blockchain** → Stores ownership and metadata
3. **Student** → Owns certificate in wallet, can view/download PDF
4. **Verifier (Employer)** → Verifies authenticity instantly, can view PDF

## Demo Conclusion

**"This system demonstrates how blockchain technology can revolutionize credential verification, making it tamper-proof, instant, and truly owned by students while providing employers with trustless verification capabilities."**

## Next Steps
